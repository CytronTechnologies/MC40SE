-This is folder for Sample Source code of MC40SE.
-All code being developed and compiled under:
~MPLAB IDE v8.63 + HI TECH C Compiler for PIC10/12/16 MCUs (Lite Mode) v9.80
-Other version of software might have different identifier for register. Cytron do not bare the resposibility to ensure code compatible
-All files are free to modify, but we do not support modification. It is user resposibility to do so.
-These files and example are for reference only.

Open MPLAB IDE, open this project from Project - > Open..., select MC40SE.mcp file.
The MPLAB will automatic open all the files. By default, the project is compiled with "MC40SE 16F887 Template.c".
If you want to change other example, please remove "MC40SE 16F887 Template.c" from project window under "Source Files" 
and add the file you like to compile such as "MC40SE 16F887 Analog.c". 
There cannot be two or more main function in a project. All c files start with MC40SE will have a main function in it.
Therefore a project cannot have more than one file that start with "MC40SE".

Hex file for all example have been label properly, you can download it using PICkit 2 software.
